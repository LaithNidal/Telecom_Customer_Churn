* The notebook goes over the Data Analysis framework of Exploratory Data Exploration where the data is visualizaed using matplotlib as well as pandas for Data Cleaning ensuring there are no discrpencies in the raw data, null values were also accounted for, proper column formatting was also applied as part of the data cleaning process so that the data would be usable in training and fitting of several bianry classification models such as :Random Forest Classifier (RFC), XGB Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Adaboost to name a few.
*  The accuracy and precision score for the models were plotted across 50 random states and averaged for each of the models selected.
*  Optuna was then used for Hyperparameter optimization on the RFC model were the best accuracy score obtained was 0.85 or 85 % accuracy.
